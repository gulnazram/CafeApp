1. The first registration screen, where you need to enter your login and password (2 fields) and the login button, which leads to the second screen
2. The second screen of the Cafe, where you need to register a guest: fields for entering the full name and whether there was an advance payment through the switches, whether the table was ordered (yes or no)
3. There are input fields and table numbers
4. The third screen is the score, where we display the full name, table number and amount
